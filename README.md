# Terraform

As an open source tool, Terraform provides a flexible abstraction of resources and providers.

While configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet, and Ansible install and manage software on a machine that already exists, Terraform is not a configuration management tool, and it allows existing tooling to focus on their strengths: bootstrapping and initializing resources.
